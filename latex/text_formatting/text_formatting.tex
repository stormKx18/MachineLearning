\section{Introduction}
Basic formatting tags in \LaTeX

\subsection{Text formatting}
All the things you want to do and sometimes should ... emphasis on SOMETIMES.


%Bold
\textbf{Bold formatting} is only between the curly braces.

%Italics
\emph{Italics Formatting}

%Underline
\underline{Underline Formatting}

\subsection{Paragraph formatting}
New paragraphs are autamically indented.

This is another paragraph.

%No indent
\noindent But sometimes you don't want them to be.

\section{Oddities}
Strange things I noticed.

\subsection{Misquoting}
This is how I would normally type 'single' and "double" quotes. Doesn't it look odd?

\noindent Use that \emph{other} quote key you have never used before to make it better.

\noindent See my new `single' quotes, and ``double" quotes? Ahh, that's better.


\section{Conclusion}
These are just a few of the basic elements in a \LaTeX.
